# Exercise 1.2: SDTM IG Audio Overview

## Objective
Upload the SDTM Implementation Guide and use NotebookLM's Audio Overview feature to get an AI-generated discussion of the DM domain. Then ask follow-up questions about specific variables.

## Time: 15 minutes

## Prerequisites
- NotebookLM notebook from Exercise 1.1 (or create a new one)
- PDF file: `docs/SDTMIG_v3.4.pdf`

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Upload the SDTM IG

1. In your existing notebook (or a new one), click **"Add Source"**
2. Upload `SDTMIG_v3.4.pdf`
3. **Note:** This is a large file. Processing may take 1-2 minutes. Wait for the spinner to complete.
4. Once processed, review the auto-generated **Source Guide** for the IG

### Step 2: Generate an Audio Overview

1. In the notebook panel, find the **"Audio Overview"** section
2. Before generating, click **"Customize"** (if available)
3. Add a customization prompt: **"Focus on the Demographics (DM) domain -- what variables are required, how dates should be formatted, and how race and ethnicity should be coded"**
4. Click **"Generate"**
5. The audio takes 2-5 minutes to generate. While waiting, proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Ask SDTM IG Questions (while audio generates)

Ask the following questions in the chat. These target specific DM domain knowledge that you'll need for SDTM programming:

**Question 1:** "What are the required variables for the DM domain according to the SDTM IG?"

> Record the answer (list the required variables):
> _________________________________________________________________
> _________________________________________________________________

**Question 2:** "What does the SDTM IG say about RFSTDTC? How should it be derived?"

> Record the answer:
> _________________________________________________________________
> _________________________________________________________________

**Question 3:** "How should partial dates be handled in BRTHDTC according to the IG?"

> Record the answer:
> _________________________________________________________________
> _________________________________________________________________

### Step 4: Listen to the Audio Overview

1. Once the audio is ready, play it
2. Listen for at least 2-3 minutes (you can listen to the full overview later)
3. Note any insights the audio discussion highlights that you didn't get from the chat questions

> What did the audio overview cover that the chat answers did not?
> _________________________________________________________________
> _________________________________________________________________

### Step 5: Ask a Follow-Up Based on the Audio

After listening, ask one follow-up question inspired by something mentioned in the audio overview:

> Your follow-up question:
> _________________________________________________________________
>
> The answer:
> _________________________________________________________________

## Reflection Questions

1. Is the audio overview format useful for onboarding to a new IG version? When would you use it vs. chat?
2. Were the IG citations precise enough to use as references in your mapping specification?
3. Did NotebookLM correctly distinguish between Required, Expected, and Permissible variables?
