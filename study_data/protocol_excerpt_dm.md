| **Baseline (Randomization)** | Day 0 | Randomization | Demographics collection, baseline lab work, vital signs, randomization to treatment |
| **Week 2** | Days 10-17 | Safety | Adverse events, vital signs, study drug accountability |
| **Week 6** | Days 38-45 | Efficacy/Safety | HbA1c, fasting glucose, vital signs, weight, AE assessment |

| **Week 28 (Follow-up)** | Days 192-199 | Follow-up safety | Vital signs, weight, safety labs, AE assessment |

### 4.2 Demographics Data Collection

Demographics data will be collected at the **Baseline/Randomization visit (Day 0)** and include:

- **Age at Informed Consent**: Date of birth and age in years at the time of informed consent
- **Sex**: Male or Female
- **Race**: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Multiracial (with specification of races)
- **Ethnicity**: Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino
- **Height**: Measured in centimeters at baseline (without shoes, measured to nearest 0.5 cm)
- **Weight**: Measured in kilograms at baseline (to nearest 0.1 kg, subjects in minimal clothing without shoes)
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Calculated as weight (kg) / height (m)²

### 4.3 Demographics Definitions

**Age at Informed Consent**: The difference in years between the date of informed consent and the subject's date of birth, truncated to the number of complete years.

**Baseline Age**: Age at informed consent, to be used as the baseline demographic variable.

**Race**: The racial category or categories selected by the subject. Subjects may select more than one race category.

**Ethnicity**: Hispanic/Latino status as self-reported by the subject.

**Height**: Vertical measurement of the subject's body in centimeters, measured without shoes with the subject standing against a vertical surface.

**Weight**: The subject's body mass in kilograms, measured in minimal clothing (hospital gown acceptable) without shoes.

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. BMI categories for this study are:
- Normal/Overweight: <30 kg/m²
- Obese Class I: 30.0-34.9 kg/m²
- Obese Class II: 35.0-39.9 kg/m²
- Obese Class III: ≥40 kg/m²

## 5. Randomization and Blinding

### 5.1 Randomization Method
Subjects will be randomized 2:1 (Glucotrex:placebo) in a block-randomized fashion stratified by site. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment groups upon completion of all baseline assessments and confirmation of eligibility.

### 5.2 Randomization Stratification
- **Stratification Factor 1**: Site (101-106)
- **Stratification Factor 2**: Baseline HbA1c category (<8.5%, ≥8.5%)

### 5.3 Blinding
The study is double-blind. Both subjects and investigator staff will be blinded to treatment assignment. The IWRS and sponsor will maintain the randomization code. Unblinding will only occur in cases of medical emergency or as determined by the medical monitor.

### 5.4 Randomization Data
All randomization information, including the date and time of randomization, treatment assignment, and randomization number, will be collected and documented in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.

## 6. Data Quality and Completeness

### 6.1 Demographics Data Requirements
- All demographic variables (age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight) must be collected for all randomized subjects
- Height and weight must be collected at the Baseline visit; follow-up weight measurements will be collected at designated study visits
- Missing or incomplete demographic data must be queried from the investigator site
- Queries must be resolved within 5 business days of issuance

### 6.2 Source Documentation
All demographics data must be source-documented in the subject's medical record or case report form. The CRA will verify demographic data against source documents during monitoring visits.

## 7. Relevant Definitions

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**: A metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function, resulting in hyperglycemia.

**HbA1c**: Glycated hemoglobin, expressed as a percentage, used as a measure of glycemic control over the preceding 2-3 months.

**Baseline**: The last assessment performed before the subject receives the first dose of study drug.

**Informed Consent**: Written permission obtained from the subject to participate in the study after full disclosure of the study's purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits.
